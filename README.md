# Matrix-Transpose

This is one of the assignments for Computational Problem Solving for Engineers

* The goal is to employ **[OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/)** for parallel processing to transpose a huge square matrix in C++

* To accomplish this, I implemented the transposition of a matrix by partitioning it into smaller blocks and utilized OpenMP to perform the transposition  of smaller blocks in parallel.


[Source.cpp](Source.cpp) contains all my code for the task, and it can transpose a 2300x2300 matrix in around 27 seconds.

> I executed it using the OpenMP supported in Visual Studio 2019
> The matrix is generated by filling with random digits

[openmp_hw5.exe](openmp_hw5.exe) is the executable file for transposing a random 2300x2300 matrix
